et gains and losses from all hedges for 2005 and 2004, we need to refer to the table provided. 

From the table, we can see that the net gains/losses from fair value hedges for 2005 and 2004 are ($58) million and $199 million, respectively. 

Similarly, the net gains/losses from cash flow hedges for 2005 and 2004 are ($2) million and $2014 million, respectively. 

To calculate the total net gains and losses from all hedges, we need to sum up the net gains/losses from fair value hedges and cash flow hedges for each year. 

For 2005: 
Net gains/losses from fair value hedges = ($58) million
Net gains/losses from cash flow hedges = ($2) million
Total net gains/losses from all hedges in 2005 = ($58) million + ($2) million = ($60) million

For 2004: 
Net gains/losses from fair value hedges = $199 million
Net gains/losses from cash flow hedges = $2014 million
Total net gains/losses from all hedges in 2004 = $199 million + $2014 million = $2213 million

Therefore, the net gains and losses from all hedges for 2005 and 2004 are ($60) million and $2213 million, respectively.

The answer is: The net gains and losses from all hedges for 2005 and 2004 are ($60) million and $2213 million, respectively

Restructuring and related charges for 2018: $36,902
Restructuring and related charges for 2019: $25,914

Change in Restructuring and related charges = Restructuring and related charges for 2019 - Restructuring and related charges for 2018
= $25,914 - $36,902

To find the outstanding amount under the unsecured revolving credit facility, we need to refer to the passage. However, there is no specific information about the outstanding amount under the credit facility in the given passage.

Without the information about the outstanding amount under the credit facility, we cannot calculate the percentage. Therefore, the answer is not possible to determine with the given information

the average cash flow from 2010 to 2012, we need to add up the cash flows for each year and then divide by the number of years.

2010 cash flow: $534 million
2011 cash flow: $1001 million
2012 cash flow: $1225 million

Total cash flow from 2010 to 2012: $534 + $1001 + $1225 = $2760 million

Average cash flow from 2010 to 2012: $2760 million / 3 years = $920 million

The average cash flow from 2010 to 2012 is $920 million

the net margin for 2006, we need to divide the net earnings by the processing and services revenues for that year.

Net earnings for 2006: $259.1 million
Processing and services revenues for 2006: $2,458.8 million

Net margin = (Net earnings / Processing and services revenues) * 100
Net margin = ($259.1 million / $2,458.8 million) * 100
Net margin = 10.55%

Therefore, the net margin for 2006 is 10.55%

if the 5-year C series return outperformed the S&P 500, we need to compare the cumulative total shareholder return of the C series with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 index over the same period.

Looking at the table, we can see that the C series had the following values on December 31 of each year:
- December 31, 2012: $100.00
- December 31, 2013: $143.35
- December 31, 2014: $115.28
- December 31, 2015: $86.22
- December 31, 2016: $91.56
- December 31, 2017: $72.38

To calculate the cumulative total shareholder return for the C series, we need to find the percentage change in value from the initial investment of $100.00 to the final value on December 31, 2017.

Percentage change = ((Final value - Initial value) / Initial value) * 100

Percentage change = (($72.38 - $100.00) / $100.00) * 100

Percentage change = (-$27.62 / $100.00) * 100

Percentage change = -27.62%

Now, let's look at the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 index. Unfortunately, the table does not provide the values for the S&P 500 on December 31 of each year. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the cumulative total return for the S&P 500.

Based on the information given, we cannot determine if the 5-year C series return outperformed the S&P 500

 question, we need to look at the table and find the relevant information. The table provides marginal effects for different variables on the low-income rate of senior immigrants. We are specifically interested in the effect of "oas / gis entitlement" on the low-income rate for women.

From the table, we can see that the marginal effect of "oas / gis entitlement" for women is -0.042. This means that for every unit decrease in oas / gis entitlement, the low-income rate for women decreases by 0.042.

To calculate the percentage decline, we need to divide the marginal effect by the initial low-income rate and multiply by 100. However, the initial low-income rate for women is not provided in the table. Without this information, we cannot calculate the exact percentage decline.

Therefore, the answer is that we cannot determine the exact percentage decline in the low-income rate for women in 2016 due to a reduction in oas / gis entitlement

verage value of Current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt, Long-term debt, less current portion, and Shareholders' equity in 2012, we need to look at the corresponding values in the table.

From the table, we can see that the values for Current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt, Long-term debt, less current portion, and Shareholders' equity in 2012 are as follows:

Current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt (in thousands): 222
Long-term debt, less current portion (in thousands): 1,087,789
Shareholders' equity (in thousands): 2,108,307

To calculate the average value, we add up the values and divide by the number of values:

Average value of Current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt = (222) / 1 = 222 (in thousands)
Average value of Long-term debt, less current portion = (1,087,789) / 1 = 1,087,789 (in thousands)
Average value of Shareholders' equity = (2,108,307) / 1 = 2,108,307 (in thousands)

Therefore, the average value of Current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt, Long-term debt, less current portion, and Shareholders' equity in 2012 is $222,000, $1,087,789, and $2,108,307 respectively.

The answer is:
The average value of Current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt in 2012 is $222,000.
The average value of Long-term debt, less current portion in 2012 is $1,087,789.
The average value of Shareholders' equity in 2012 is $2,108,307

the cost to repurchase the remaining shares under the current authorization from the board of directors, we need to know the cost per share of the repurchase activity in 2011 and the number of remaining shares.

According to the passage, the cost of the share repurchase activity in 2011 was $858 million. However, the number of shares repurchased in 2011 is not provided. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the cost per share.

Without the number of shares repurchased in 2011, we cannot determine the cost to repurchase the remaining shares under the current authorization from the board of directors
the cash provided by operating activities in 2011, we need to find the growth rate from 2010 to 2011 and apply it to the cash provided by operating activities in 2010.

From the table, we can see that the cash provided by operating activities in 2010 is $703,687 (in thousands).

To find the growth rate, we can use the formula:

Growth Rate = (Value in 2011 - Value in 2010) / Value in 2010

Let's assume the growth rate is "x".

So, (Value in 2010) * (1 + x) = Value in 2011

703,687 * (1 + x) = Value in 2011

Now, we need to solve for Value in 2011.

Let's rearrange the equation:

(1 + x) = Value in 2011 / 703,687

x = (Value in 2011 / 703,687) - 1

Since we don't have the value for 2011, we cannot calculate the exact cash provided by operating activities
