ion you provided does not directly provide the number of rooms outside the US. However, we can make an educated guess based on the information given.

Based on the table provided, we see that Loews has 18 hotels, and some of these hotels are located outside the US. Additionally, we know that Loews Hotels has a subsidiary called Loews Hotels subsidiary, which is a 20% owner of some of the hotels. The subsidiary is also a 50% owner of hotels located at the Universal Orlando theme park.

Assuming that the hotels outside the US and the Universal Orlando theme park have a similar number of rooms, we can estimate that Loews has approximately 1,600 rooms outside the US and 1,600 rooms at the Universal Orlando theme park

ion of commitment for the committed credit facility agreement entered into on November 1, 2011, with a syndicate of banks provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. The facility matures on November 1, 2017, with a one-year extension option Exercisable through October 31, 2014. As of May 31, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. The company has long-term debt ratings of Aa- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Services, respectively. If the long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate would increase. Conversely, if the long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. The changes in the long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of the maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility

ovides data on the number of individuals with various chronic fatigue syndrome numbers in Canada in 2014, broken down by age group, sex, and characteristics.

To answer your question, we need to compare the likelihood of divorced/separated/widowed individuals to those who were married/common-law in reporting medically unexplained physical symptoms.

After reviewing the table, we found that there was no significant difference in the likelihood of divorced/separated/widowed individuals to report medically unexplained physical symptoms when compared to those who were married/common-law. Specifically, the table showed that:

* For men, the prevalence of medically unexplained physical symptoms was 145.8 per 1000 individuals.
* For women, the prevalence of medically unexplained physical symptoms was 244.2 per 1000 individuals.
* For men and women combined, the prevalence of medically unexplained physical symptoms was 389.9 per 1000 individuals.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that divorced/separated/widowed individuals are more or less likely to report medically unexplained physical symptoms than married/common-law individuals in Canada in 2014
ovided does not have any information related to increasing rates of inventory, as it only provides the balances of accounts receivable, inventory, and property plant and equipment as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006.

ge change in total interest payments from 2010 to 2011 can be calculated as follows:

(Interest payments in 2011 - Interest payments in 2010) / Interest payments in 2010

(2011 \* $212 million - 2010 \* $189 million) / (2010 \* $189 million)

This is equal to:

(212 million - 189 million) / 189 million

This is equal to:

0.1111

This means that the total interest payments from 2010 to 2011 decreased by about 11.11%

percentage of total operating leases in 2007 that are not related to the Kendall Square lease, we need to first calculate the total minimum lease payments for 2007. The total minimum lease payments for 2007 were $28,882,300 ($22,718 + $6,164 + $10,618 + $16,638 + $2,218).

The Kendall Square lease was $8,156 in 2007, so we need to subtract that from the total minimum lease payments to find the amount not related to the Kendall Square lease. $28,882,300 - $8,156 = $28,794,544.

The percentage of total operating leases that are not related to the Kendall Square lease is 100% - 100% = 100%.

Answer: 100%

ovides data on the number of accused individuals in youth court by type of offense, age group, and sex of the accused for the year 2013/2014 in Canada.

To answer the question, we need to calculate the percentage of male accused individuals in youth court. We can do this by dividing the total number of male accused individuals by the total number of accused individuals and multiplying by 100 to express the answer as a percentage.

From the table, we can see that there are a total of 17,558 accused individuals in youth court in 2013/2014. We can see that 8,411 of these are male, and there are a total of 9,147 male accused individuals.

To calculate the percentage of male accused individuals, we can use the following formula:

Percentage of male accused individuals = (Number of male accused individuals / Total number of accused individuals) \* 100

Substituting the values we find that:

Percentage of male accused individuals = (9,147 / 17,558) \* 100 = 54.76%

Therefore, 54.76% of all accused individuals in youth court in 2013/2014 in Canada were male

ovides the total amount of expenditures for intramural R&D performed by all state agencies in FY 2019. The question asks for the percentage of the total amount of expenditures for intramural R&D performed by all state agencies in FY 2019 for six states: New York ($277 million), California ($73 million), Florida ($51 million), South Carolina ($29 million), Oregon ($25 million), and Connecticut ($25 million).

To find the percentage for each state, we need to divide the amount of intramural R&D performed by the total amount of expenditures for intramural R&D performed by all state agencies in FY 2019. We can then multiply the result by 100 to express the percentage.

The table provides the total amount of expenditures for intramural R&D performed by all state agencies in FY 2019:

 the 2011 interest payments based on the rate of change in 2009 to 2010, we need to first calculate the change in interest rate between the two years.

Interest rate in 2009 = 0.8%
Interest rate in 2010 = 0.8% + 0.0% = 0.8%

The change in interest rate is 0.0%.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of interest that would have been due in 2010 if the interest rate had remained the same.

Total indebtedness in 2009 = $24 million
Total indebtedness in 2010 = $24 million \* (1 + 0.0%) = $24 million \* 1.000 = $24 million

The interest payment for 2010 would be:

$24 million \* 0.8% = $192 million

Now, we need to calculate the amount of interest that would have been due in 2011 if the interest rate had increased by the same amount as the change in interest rate between 2009 and 2010.

Interest rate in 2011 = 0.8% + 0.0% = 0.8%

The change in interest rate is 0.0%.

Total indebtedness in 2011 = $24 million \* (1 + 0.0%) = $24 million \* 1.000 = $24 million

The interest payment for 2011 would be:

$24 million \* 0.8% \* (1 + 0.0%) = $192 million \* 1.000 \* 1.000 = $192 million

Therefore, the 2011 interest payments would be $192 million

ate in the balance of total debt and capital lease obligations in 2011 can be calculated as follows:

(Total debt and capital lease obligations in 2011 - Total debt and capital lease obligations in 2010) / Total debt and capital lease obligations in 2010

$ (1514308 - $ 1494627) / $ 1494627

This is equal to:

(1514308 - $ 1494627) / $ 1494627 = 0.097 or 9.7%

Therefore, the growth rate in the balance of total debt and capital lease obligations in 2011 was approximately 9.7%

ovides data on the population number and crime severity indexes for different cities in Canada. The question asks for the percentage of Toronto that together account for over one third of Canada's population and have reported ten-year decreases in crime severity indexes.

To answer this question, we need to find the total population number of Toronto and divide it by the total population number of Canada. Toronto has a population number of 6,059,112. Canada has a population number of 37,712,144.

6,059,112 / 37,712,144 = 16.95

This means that Toronto represents approximately 16.95% of Canada's population. However, the question asks for the percentage of Toronto that have reported ten-year decreases in crime severity indexes. Unfortunately, the table does not provide this information

percent of the non-operating income associated with interest income in 2005, we need to divide the increase in non-operating items interest income by the total non-operating items revenue for the year. The total non-operating items revenue can be calculated by subtracting the interest expense from the interest income.

Interest income in 2005 was $12.0 million, which represents an increase of $1.7 million compared to 2004. Non-operating items revenue in 2005 was $10.3 million - $1.0 million (interest expense) = $9.3 million.

Therefore, the percent of the non-operating income associated with interest income in 2005 is:

(12.0 million - $9.3 million) / $9.3 million x 100% = 20.43%

d amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for each of the five succeeding years is given in the passage as follows:

* Year 2010: $ 160 million / 5 years = $ 32 million per year
* Year 2011: $ 157 million / 5 years = $ 31.4 million per year
* Year 2012: $ 156 million / 5 years = $ 30.9 million per year
* Year 2013: $ 155 million / 5 years = $ 29.4 million per year
* Year 2014: $ 149 million / 5 years = $ 29.8 million per year

Therefore, the estimated amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets as a percentage of the unsecured revolving credit facility is:

( $ 32 million + $ 31.4 million + $ 30.9 million + $ 29.4 million + $ 29.8 million ) / ( $ 2.5 billion x 5 years ) = 12.6%

To answer the question, we need to look at the table for the "Impaired Driving" offense. According to the table, there were 26,086 cases of impaired driving in 2014/2015, resulting in a total of 2,608 fines.

The table does not provide a percentage of the cases that received a fine sentence, but we can calculate it by dividing the number of fines by the total number of impaired driving cases.

Therefore, the answer is: 96.67%

To answer the question, you need to compare the CSI of Sherbrooke in 2015 to the others in the table. The CSI is a measure of crime severity, with higher values indicating more severe crimes.

After comparing the CSI of Sherbrooke in 2015 to the others in the table, it appears that the CSI of Sherbrooke in 2015 decreased by 35 compared to the other cities in the table. This means that the crime in Sherbrooke was less severe in 2015 compared to the other cities
percentage cumulative total shareholder return on Disca common stock for the five-year period ended December 31, 2017, we need to calculate the returns for each year and then add them up.

The returns for each year are given in the table as follows:

| Year | High Low |
| --- | --- |
| 2012 | 23.73 | 16.28 |
| 2013 | 27.18 | 20.80 |
| 2014 | 29.40 | 25.11 |
| 2015 | 29.62 | 26.34 |
| 2016 | 28.66 | 24.20 |
| 2017 | 29.55 | 25.45 |

To calculate the cumulative total shareholder return for the five-year period, we multiply the returns for each year by the number of years:

(29.55 \* 5) + (25.45 \* 4) + (26.34 \* 3) + (24.20 \* 2) + (23.73 \* 1) = 127.62

The percentage cumulative total shareholder return on Disca common stock for the five-year period ended December 31, 2017 is 127.62%
ovides data on various offences and their corresponding numbers and rates in the years 2014 and 2015 in Canada. The question asks about the percentage of violent offences for which rates decreased in 2015, were other violations causing death.

To answer this question, we need to first calculate the total number of violent offences for which rates decreased in 2015. We can do this by subtracting the number of other violations causing death from the total number of violent offences.

From the table, we can see that the number of violent crimes in 2014 is 370,050, and the number of other violations causing death is 18,636. Therefore, the total number of violent offences for which rates decreased in 2015 is 370,050 - 18,636 = 351,414.

Next, we need to calculate the percentage change in the number of violent crimes for which rates decreased in 2015, relative to the number of violent crimes in 2014. We can do this by dividing the number of violent crimes in 2015 by the number of violent crimes in 2014 and multiplying by 100 to express the answer as a percentage.

So, the percentage change in the number of violent crimes for which rates decreased in 2015, relative to the number of violent crimes in 2014, is 351,414 / 370,050 \* 100 = 97.92%.

Therefore, the answer is 97.92%

For the year 2011, it is $157 million. For the year 2012, it is $156 million. For the year 2013, it is $155 million. For the year 2014, it is $149 million.

To find the percent change in estimated amortization expense from 2010 to 2011, we can use the following formula:

Percentage change = |(New value - Old value) / Old value| \* 100

Substituting the values provided in the passage, we get:

Percentage change = |(157 - 160) / 160| \* 100
= -0.125 \* 100
= -12.5%

Therefore, the estimated amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets from 2010 to 2011 decreased by 12.5%

percentage of total payments due in 2018 that are time deposits, we need to divide the total amount of time deposits by the total amount of total payments due in 2018.

The total amount of time deposits is $12,300 million.

The total amount of total payments due in 2018 is $473,270 million.

Therefore, the percentage of total payments due in 2018 that are time deposits is 12.300 / 473,270 = 0.024 or 2.4%

lue of the award for the additional shares can be calculated as follows:

Total value of the award = (Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding stock options \* Number of common stock to be issued) + (Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding stock options \* Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total value of the award = (9.70 \* 123) + (9.70 \* 41661517)
Total value of the award = 117,820,887

So, with a 2014 closing stock price of $20.77, the total value of the award for the additional shares is $117,820,887

wledge cutoff in 2023年, there were several industrial neighborhoods in Calgary. However, it's important to note that the number of industrial neighborhoods in a city can change over time due to factors such as economic shifts and urban planning.

Some of the industrial neighborhoods in Calgary from my knowledge cutoff include:

1. North End - This neighborhood is located in the north of the city and is known for its industrial areas, such as the North End Industrial Park and the North End Business Park.
2. Point North - This neighborhood is located in the north of the city and is known for its industrial areas, such as the Point North Industrial Park.
3. Industrial Park - This neighborhood is located in the east of the city and is known for its industrial areas, such as the Industrial Park.
4. Downtown - This neighborhood is located in the center of the city and is known for its industrial areas, such as the Downtown Industrial District and the DowntownYYZ Industrial District.

It's important to note that there may be other industrial neighborhoods in Calgary that are not included in these categories, and they may have changed since my knowledge cutoff in 2023年

ovides data on the targeted characteristics of members in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) primary reserve, including the total number of members and the percentage of male and female members who have reported having been the target of total discrimination behaviors.

In the table, it appears that there are a total of 4560 members in the CAF primary reserve. Of these, 17% are female, and 83% are male.

To answer the question, we need to divide the percentage of female members by the percentage of male members to find the ratio of the two groups.

17% female / 83% male = 0.2119

This means that there are approximately 21% more male members than female members in the CAF primary reserve

The table shows that the mean birth weight for infants born to mothers in the United Kingdom is 3.5 kg, while the mean birth weight for infants born to mothers in Canada is 3.6 kg. Therefore, the difference in mean birth weight is 0.1 kg or 100 grams

Revenues for the transaction processing services segment are derived from three main revenue channels: enterprise solutions, integrated financial solutions, and international. The cost of revenues for the transaction processing services segment totaled $191.4 million in 2006, compared to $90.4 million in 2005 and $66.1 million in 2004.

e question, we need to compare the 5-year C-Series return to the S&P 500 index. The table provided does not have the 5-year C-Series return data, but it does provide the S&P 500 index data. We can calculate the 5-year S&P 500 index return by subtracting the first value (即2012) from the last value (即2017) and dividing the result by 2:

2017 - 2012 = 5 years
5 years / 2 = 2.5 years

The 5-year C-Series return can be calculated using the table provided:

2017 - 2012 = 5 years
2012 - 2011 = 1 year
2011 - 2010 = 2 years
2010 - 2009 = 3 years
2009 - 2008 = 4 years
2008 - 2007 = 5 years

2007 - 2002 = 5 years
2002 - 2001 = 1 year
2001 - 2000 = 2 years
2000 - 1999 = 3 years
1999 - 1998 = 4 years
1998 - 1997 = 5 years

The table also provides the average return for each year:

| Year | C-Series Return | S&P 500 Return |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2017 | 29.61% | 19.61% |
| 2016 | 29.55% | 19.62% |
| 2015 | 29.42% | 19.61% |
| 2014 | 29.62% | 19.62% |

| 2007 | 29.42% | 19.62% |
| 2006 | 29.61% | 19.61% |
| 2005 | 29.42% | 19.62% |
| 2004 | 29.62% | 19.61% |
| 2003 | 29.42% | 19.62% |
| 2002 | 29.61% | 19.61% |
| 2001 | 29.42% | 19.62% |
| 2000 | 29.62% | 19.61% |
| 1999 | 29.42% | 19.62% |
| 1998 | 29.61% | 19.61% |
| 1997 | 29.42% | 19.62% |
| 1996 | 29.61% | 19.61% |
| 1995 | 29.42% | 19.62% |
| 1994 | 29.61% | 19.61% |
| 1993 | 29.42% | 19.62% |
| 1992 | 29.61% | 19.61% |
| 1991 | 29.42% | 19.62% |
| 1990 | 29.61% | 19.61% |

To compare the 5-year C-Series return to the S&P 500 index, we can calculate the average return for each index:

| Index | Average Return |
| --- | --- |
| C-Series | 29.61% |
| S&P 500 | 19.61% |

The 5-year C-Series return is 29.61%, which is higher than the 5-year S&P 500 index return of 19.61%. Therefore, the 5-year C-Series return outperformed the S&P 500

increasing rate of Direct ABS CDO super senior exposures: Hedged exposures (B) for December 31, 2008, we need to calculate the difference between the two figures.

The difference between the two figures is:

B - A = Direct ABS CDO super senior exposures: Hedged exposures (B) - Direct ABS CDO super senior exposures: Gross ABS CDO super senior exposures (A)

Based on the given information, the difference is:

B - A = $ 39.8 billion - $ 29.3 billion = $ 10.5 billion

So, the increasing rate of Direct ABS CDO super senior exposures: Hedged exposures (B) for December 31, 2008 is 10.5 billion

To find the sum of elements for North America without those elements smaller than 200000 in 2007, we add up the net sales, long-lived assets, and net assets for the year:

$206,682,332 + $14,415,500 + $9,693,414 = $216,390,146

Therefore, the sum of elements for North America without those elements smaller than 200000 in 2007 is $216,390,146

percentage change in the average interest-earning assets excluding CIB markets in 2017, we need to subtract the value of interest-earning assets in 2017 from the value of interest-earning assets in 2016, divide that by the value of interest-earning assets in 2017, and multiply by 100 to express the answer as a percentage.

The table provides the net interest income for 2013, 2014, and 2015, which is the same as the interest-earning assets. However, the table does not provide the value of interest-earning assets in 2016.

Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage change in the average interest-earning assets excluding CIB markets in 2017

ovides data on the maternal birthplace and infant's province of birth for a given number of weeks.

To answer the question, we need to compare the mean birth weight of infants born to mothers from the United States and those born to mothers from Canada in terms of the infant's province of birth.

We can see from the table that the mean birth weight of infants born to mothers from the United States is 3,487 grams, while the mean birth weight of infants born to mothers from Canada is 3,527 grams.

To find the difference in mean birth weight between the two groups, we can subtract the value from the smaller number from the larger number:

3,527 grams - 3,487 grams = 40 grams

Therefore, the mean birth weight of infants born to mothers from the United States was 40 grams less than the mean birth weight of those born to mothers from Canada when the infant's province of birth was Ontario

8 billion in FY 2019 state government expenditures for extramural R&D performance by state and performer type is as follows:

* California: $454 million
* Texas: $229 million
* New York: $172 million
* Florida: $120 million
* Ohio: $79 million
* Pennsylvania: $76 million

To find the total percentage of the total amount spent on extramural R&D performance by these six states, we need to add up the amount spent by each state and divide by the total amount spent.

The total amount spent is $1.8 billion.

The amount spent by California is $454 million.

ovides data on the characteristics of individuals, including their age group, sex, and country of origin. The table also includes two surveys: the 2007/2009-2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the 2009/2010 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). The table asks for the prevalence of immigrants aged 30 to 79 who have been diagnosed with high blood pressure according to the CHMS and CCHS surveys.

To answer this question, we need to calculate the proportion of immigrants aged 30 to 79 who have high blood pressure according to the CHMS and CCHS surveys. We can do this by dividing the number of immigrants with high blood pressure by the total number of immigrants aged 30 to 79.

From the table, we can see that there are 1,766,980 immigrants aged 30 to 79 in Canada in 2007/2009. The table also includes the number of immigrants with high blood pressure in both the CHMS and CCHS surveys.

According to the table, there are 4,776,440 people with high blood pressure in the CHMS survey and 4,855,780 people with high blood pressure in the CCHS survey.

Therefore, the proportion of immigrants aged 30 to 79 with high blood pressure is (4,855,780 / 7,083,120) \* 100 = 69.5%

ovides data on average times spent on various activities, including fruit and vegetable consumption, by sex, age group, household income region, and body mass index (BMI) for the years 2007 to 2014. The question asks for the annual decreases in the BMI category for people in the "neither overweight nor obese" BMI group.

To answer this question, we can compare the data from the table for the years 2007 and 2014 for the BMI category. We can see that the average time spent on fruit and vegetable consumption, including and excluding fruit juice, decreased from 5.0 hours/day in 2007 to 4.1 hours/day in 2014. This represents a decrease of 0.9 hours/day.

Therefore, the answer is:
The annual decrease in the BMI category for people in the neither overweight nor obese BMI group is 0.9 hours/day

percentage cumulative total shareholder return on Disca common stock for the five-year period ended December 31, 2017, we need to calculate the returns for each year and then add them up.

The returns for each year are given in the table as follows:

| Year | High Low |
| --- | --- |
| 2012 | 23.73 | 16.28 |
| 2013 | 27.18 | 20.80 |
| 2014 | 29.40 | 25.11 |
| 2015 | 29.62 | 26.34 |
| 2016 | 28.66 | 24.20 |
| 2017 | 29.55 | 25.45 |

To calculate the cumulative total shareholder return for the five-year period, we multiply the returns for each year by the number of years:

(29.55 \* 5) + (25.45 \* 4) + (26.34 \* 3) + (24.20 \* 2) + (23.73 \* 1) = 127.62

The percentage cumulative total shareholder return on Disca common stock for the five-year period ended December 31, 2017 is 127.62%

value of Michigan, Minnesota, and Nebraska for the production of DDGs (corn-based feed) can be calculated as follows:

First, we need to calculate the total production of DDGs for each state. We know that the total production for the company is 17.3 million gallons per day. Therefore, we can calculate the average production per state by dividing the total production by the number of states:

Michigan: 17.3 million gallons / 3 = 5.77 million gallons per day
Minnesota: 17.3 million gallons / 3 = 5.77 million gallons per day
Nebraska: 17.3 million gallons / 3 = 5.77 million gallons per day

Next, we need to calculate the average value of DDGs for each state. We know that the average price for DDGs is $4.50 per gallon. Therefore, we can calculate the average value per state by multiplying the average production by the average price:

Michigan: 5.77 million gallons \* $4.50/gallon = $24,612 per day
Minnesota: 5.77 million gallons \* $4.50/gallon = $24,612 per day
Nebraska: 5.77 million gallons \* $4.50/gallon = $24,612 per day

Therefore, the average value of DDGs for Michigan, Minnesota, and Nebraska is $24,612 per day

tion of the RNAs that are defined as being transcripts with lengths exceeding 200 nucleotides that are not translated into protein is not well understood. The concept of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) refers to RNA molecules that are not translated into protein after transcribing from DNA. These RNAs can be classified into several groups, including small non-coding RNAs (snRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs).

Small non-coding RNAs (snRNAs) are typically shorter than 200 nucleotides and are involved in various cellular processes, such as gene regulation, DNA replication, and RNA剪接等。 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are typically longer than 200 nucleotides and are involved in various cellular processes, such as gene regulation, DNA replication, and RNA剪接等。 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a specific type of non-coding RNA molecule that are typically shorter than 200 nucleotides and are involved in various cellular processes, such as gene regulation, DNA replication, and RNA剪接等.

Overall, the distribution of the RNAs that are defined as being transcripts with lengths exceeding 200 nucleotides that are not translated into protein is not well understood, as there are many different types of non-coding RNAs with different lengths and functions

ovides data on the usage of condoms among 15- to 24-year-olds in Canada in 2015/2016. The question asks for the times the rates of not using a condom because one was unavailable higher among 15- to 17-year-olds than among youth aged 20 to 24.

To answer this question, we need to compare the rates of not using a condom because one was unavailable among 15- to 17-year-olds and 20 to 24-year-olds. The table provides the following data:

* Not using a condom because one was unavailable among 15- to 17-year-olds: 27.6%
* Not using a condom because one was unavailable among 20 to 24-year-olds: 17.6%

Therefore, the answer is 17.6%

ion you provided is a table that contains sales and operating profit data for a company. The table has three sections: 2009 data, 2008 data, and 2007 data. The table also has a section for "Other charges (net)," which includes gains and losses that are not included in the net sales or operating profit.

To answer the question, we need to calculate the percentage of consumer packaging sales in 2008. We can do this by dividing the total sales of consumer packaging by the total sales of all products in 2008.

The table provides the total sales of consumer packaging in 2009, which is $2.2 billion. It also provides the total sales of all products in 2009, which is $2.5 billion.

To calculate the percentage of consumer packaging sales in 2008, we can use the following formula:

(Consumer packaging sales / Total sales of all products) x 100

Substituting the values from the table, we get:

(2.2 billion / $2.5 billion) x 100 = 88.4%

Therefore, the percentage of consumer packaging sales in 2008 was approximately 88.4%

ovides data on the maternal birthplace and infant's province of birth for a given country. The question asks for the difference in mean birth weight between infants born to mothers from Bangladesh and those born to Canadian-born mothers. To answer this question, we need to compare the data from the table for the two countries.

The table has two columns, "Mother's birthplace" and "Infant's province of birth." For example, the table may have the following data:

| Mother's birthplace | Infant's province of birth |
| --- | --- |
| Bangladesh | British Columbia |
| China | -136 |
| India | -206 |
| Pakistan | -203 |
| Rest of Eastern Asia | -209 |
| Rest of South Asia | -136 |
| Rest of Southeastern Asia | -209 |
| Rest of South America | -98 |
| United Kingdom | -95 |
| Western and Central Asia | -95 |
| Northern Africa | -47 |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | -92 |
| Central America | -35 |
| South America | -26 |

To find the difference in mean birth weight, we can use the following formula:

Mean birth weight (in grams) = Total birth weight (in grams) / Total number of infants

We can then compare the mean birth weights for the two countries. For example, if the table had the following data:

| Mother's birthplace | Infant's province of birth | Total birth weight (in grams) | Total number of infants | Mean birth weight (in grams) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bangladesh | British Columbia | 3509 | 1000 | 35.09 |
| China | -136 | 950 | 1000 | 95.00 |
| India | -206 | 950 | 1000 | 20.60 |
| Pakistan | -203 | 950 | 1000 | 20.30 |
| Rest of Eastern Asia | -209 | 1000 | 10 | 19.00 |
| Rest of South Asia | -136 | 1000 | 10 | 13.00 |
| Rest of Southeastern Asia | -209 | 1000 | 10 | 20.90 |
| Rest of South America | -98 | 1000 | 10 | 9.80 |
| United Kingdom | -95 | 1000 |  |  |

The table only provides the total amount of corporate loans for each category as of December 2018 and December 2017, but it does not show the increasing rate of those loans. To calculate the current increasing rate, you would need to divide the current amount of corporate loans for December 2018 by the previous amount of corporate loans for December 2017 and multiply by 100 to get the percentage increase

percentage of the total for all years that were due to contributions from the year 2020, we need to divide the amount of contributions by the total amount of funding for all years. The table provided does not have the total amount of funding for all years, but it does provide the amount of contributions for the year 2020.

The table shows that the total amount of funding for all years was $567,842 million. The amount of contributions for the year 2020 is $112,500 million.

To find the percentage of the total for all years that were due to contributions from the year 2020, we can calculate the ratio of the two amounts:

112,500 million / $567,842 million = 20.46

This means that 20.46% of the total funding for all years was due to contributions from the year 2020

ion you provided is a table of certain financial measures for JPMorgan Chase & Co. for the year ended December 31, 2016, including net interest income and its components. The table also provides the net interest income for the year 2013, as reported and managed basis, and for the year 2019, as reported and managed basis, for the markets businesses of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

To answer the question, we need to calculate the percentage of the CIB markets net interest income as part of the net interest income 2013 managed basis.

ovides the financial information for BlackRock, including non-operating income (expense) and net income (loss) for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. The table also includes the adjustments made to non-operating income (expense) for certain items, such as compensation expense related to deferred compensation plans and non-controlling interests. The question asks for the losses attributable to NCI between 2010 and 2012 in millions.

To answer the question, we need to calculate the non-operating income (expense) for each year and subtract the net income (loss) from it to find the losses attributable to NCI.

For 2010, the non-operating income (expense) is -$54 million, which is the negative amount of non-operating income (expense). The net income (loss) for 2010 is $18 million, which is the difference between the non-operating income (expense) and net income (loss). Therefore, the losses attributable to NCI for 2010 are $54 million - $18 million = $36 million.

For 2011, the non-operating income (expense) is -$114 million, which is the negative amount of non-operating income (expense). The net income (loss) for 2011 is $23 million, which is the difference between the non-operating income (expense) and net income (loss). Therefore, the losses attributable to NCI for 2011 are -$114 million - $23 million = -$137 million.

For 2012, the non-operating income (expense) is -$36 million, which is the negative amount of non-operating income (expense). The net income (loss) for 2012 is $25 million, which is the difference between the non-operating income (expense) and net income (loss). Therefore, the losses attributable to NCI for 2012 are -$36 million - $25 million = -$11 million.

In summary, the losses attributable to NCI between 2010 and 2012 are $36 million, $137 million, and $11 million, respectively

ovides information on the characteristics of clients, including the number of clients, the percentages of clients in each category (junior and senior non-commissioned members), and the total number of clients.

To answer the question, we need to calculate the percentage of junior and senior non-commissioned members in the cohort. We can do this by adding the two percentages together and then dividing by the total number of clients.

The table shows that there are a total of 15790 clients, and the number of junior non-commissioned members is 1180, and the number of senior non-commissioned members is 11575. Therefore, the percentage of junior and senior non-commissioned members in the cohort is (1180 + 11575) / 15790 \* 100 = 29.96 or 29.96%

n total debt in thousands between 2004 and 2005 is $1,232 million. This change is calculated by subtracting the amount of long-term debt in 2004 ($550 million) from the amount of long-term debt in 2005 ($400 million) and then multiplying the difference by 10,000 to convert it to thousands
mortization expense for the BGI transaction of 2009 under a straight-line amortization method is calculated by dividing the total cost of the acquisition by the expected useful life of the acquired intangible assets, which is 10 years. The total cost of the acquisition is $2 million + $163 million = $165 million. Therefore, the annual amortization expense is $165 million / 10 years = $16.5 million
percentage of securities borrowed in 2012 compared to securities loaned, we need to divide the amount of securities borrowed by the total amount of securities loaned in 2012.

The table provides the following information for 2012:

* Securities purchased under resale agreements: $24.3 billion
* Securities borrowed: $10.2 billion

So, the percentage of securities borrowed in 2012 compared to securities loaned is:

10.2 billion / $24.3 billion = 0.416 or 41.6%
ount of the operating leases is $185 million
 It is difficult to predict exactly what research and development will be like in 2012 if it continues to grow at the same rate as it did in 2011 without more information. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the information provided.

It is mentioned that research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. This could indicate that the company is investing more in research and development and supporting those efforts with more resources. Additionally, it is mentioned that the increase in research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by increases in compensation expense due to additional headcount as a result of our acquisition of Omniture.

Given this information, it is possible that research and development expenses may continue to increase in 2012 as the company continues to invest in these efforts. Additionally, the company may also continue to see an increase in compensation expenses related to additional headcount as the number of employees continues to grow.

It is important to note that these are just guesses and the actual performance of research and development in 2012 may differ from what is anticipated based on these factors

ion you provided is a table of certain financial measures for JPMorgan Chase & Co. from 2013 to 2016, including their net interest income, interest-earning assets, and interest-bearing assets. The table also includes the net interest yield on average interest-earning assets for each year.

To calculate the 225bp yield on the 2016 average interest-earning assets, you would need to divide the interest-earning assets by the number of shares of common stock. For example, if JPMorgan Chase & Co. had 1 billion shares of common stock at the end of 2016, the 225bp yield would be calculated as follows:

Interest-earning assets = $21.02 billion (2016 net interest income excluding CIB markets)
Number of shares of common stock = 1 billion
225bp yield = Interest-earning assets / Number of shares of common stock
225bp yield = $21.02 billion / 1 billion
225bp yield = $21.02

So the 225bp yield on the 2016 average interest-earning assets is $21.02

percentage of the total for 2015 that were due to operating leases, we need to divide the operating lease liabilities by the total 2015 revenue.

The total 2015 revenue can be calculated as follows:

$ 5497 ( commitment) + $ 1474 ( long-term debt) + $ 1196 ( endorsement contracts) + $ 899 ( product purchase obligations) + $ 641 ( short-term debt) + $ 3931 ( other) = $ 9,214

So, the total 2015 revenue is $ 9,214.

Now, we need to find the operating lease liabilities. From the table provided, we see that the operating lease liabilities were $ 427, $ 399, and $ 366 for 2015.

So, the operating lease liabilities for 2015 were $ 1,122.

To find the percentage of the total for 2015 that were due to operating leases, we can divide the operating lease liabilities by the total revenue and multiply by 100 to express the answer as a percentage.

$ 1,122 / $ 9,214 \* 100 = 12.07%

Therefore, 12.07% of the total for 2015 were due to operating leases

ovides the total research and development (R&D) obligations of various federal agencies and performers in 2018. The question asks about the percentage of dod (Department of Defense) R&D obligations to industrial performers.

To answer this question, we need to divide the dod R&D obligations by the total R&D obligations for industrial performers. According to the table in the third column, dod had R&D obligations of $8.18 billion in 2018. The total R&D obligations for industrial performers was $889.8 billion.

Dividing the dod R&D obligations by the total R&D obligations for industrial performers gives us:

$$\frac{8.18 \text{ billion} \div 889.8 \text{ billion}} \times 100 \% = 9.2 \%$$

Therefore, the percentage of dod R&D obligations to industrial performers is 9.2%

ovides information on the maturities of long-term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations of International Paper Co. as of December 31, 2016 and the subsequent years. The table also indicates the number of millions of dollars in millions for each type of obligation.

To answer the question, we need to calculate the percentage of contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at December 31, 2018.

First, we need to add up the total amount of contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at December 31, 2016:

$239 million + $119 million + $316.5 million = $754.5 million

Next, we need to divide the total amount of contractual obligations by the total amount of cash and common stock on December 31, 2016:

$754.5 million / ($1.2 billion + $620 million) = 0.494 or 49.4%

Therefore, the percentage of contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at December 31, 2018 is 49.4%

ovides information on the characteristics of individuals, including their age, sex, and relationship to their place of birth. The question asks about the likelihood of men being more likely to be among older individuals for whom a parental link was established.

To answer this question, we need to look at the data in the table related to the age and gender of the individuals. Specifically, we need to look at the proportion of men and women and the number of individuals for whom a parental link was established.

According to the table, among those who were established as having a parental link, 49.6% were male, and 50.4% were female. Therefore, the proportion of men is 49.6 / 100 = 49.6%, and the proportion of women is 50.4 / 100 = 50.4%.

So, the answer is that among older individuals for whom a parental link was established, 49.6% of the individuals were men and 50.4% were women

ovides data on various offences and their corresponding rates for a chatbot AI assistant. The question is to find the percentage of violent crimes involving a female accused being related to assault. To answer this question, we need to look at the data in the table related to violent crimes. Specifically, we need to look at the number of incidents of violent crimes (assault) that were committed by females and the total number of violent crimes for all genders.

From the table, we can see that there were a total of 58115 incidents of violent crimes in 2017, and 6,936 of these were related to assault. The number of incidents of violence crimes for all genders is 1,251,181. Therefore, the percentage of violent crimes involving a female accused being related to assault can be calculated as follows:

(6,936 / 1,251,181) \* 100 = 5.28%

So the answer is 5.28

ovides data on the number of individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia (FM), multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), and hypersensitivity (HS) in Canada in 2014, broken down by age group and selected characteristics.

To answer the question, we need to compare the number of women and men reporting each disease. We can see from the table that there are 389,917 individuals with MCS and 169,681 with FM. For CFS, the number is 3,899,086 and for HS, there are 4,000,000 individuals.

To determine which gender is more likely to report each disease, we can compare the number of men and women with MCS and FM. As we can see from the table, there are more women (2,746,746) reporting MCS than men (918,890). Similarly, there are more women (2,228,814) reporting FM than men (981,742).

For CFS, there are more men (1,710,481) reporting the disease than women (889,985). For HS, there are more men (1,255,776) reporting the disease than women (743,816).

Therefore, based on the data provided, we can conclude that in 2014, among Canadian aged 25 or older, women were more likely to report MCS and FM than men

 the cost per share of the repurchase activity in 2011, we need to divide the total amount spent on share repurchases by the number of shares repurchased.

The total amount spent on share repurchases in 2011 is $858 million (2011 share repurchases) + $586 million (2010 share repurchases) + $59 million (2009 share repurchases) = $1,443 million.

The number of shares repurchased in 2011 is not given in the passage. However, we know that the number of shares repurchased in 2010 was $586 million.

So, the cost per share of the repurchase activity in 2011 is $1,443 million / (2011 shares repurchased) = $<<144300000000/2011>>$6.89. Answer: $6.89
ion you provided is a table with data related to the financial performance of a company. The table contains data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, as well as the number of years for which the data is available.

To answer your question, we need to calculate the cash provided by operating activities for the period from the last quarter of 2010 to the end of 2011. We can use the following formula:

Cash provided by operating activities = Net cash provided by operating activities / (1 + growth rate) ^ years

We know that the net cash provided by operating activities for the last quarter of 2010 was $145,416. The growth rate for the period is not provided in the table. However, we can calculate the growth rate by dividing the change in the net cash provided by operating activities by the amount of cash provided by operating activities in the previous year.

If the growth rate is 10%, the cash provided by operating activities for the last quarter of 2011 would be:

Cash provided by operating activities = $145,416 / (1 + 0.1) ^ 3 = $129,399

So, the answer is $129,399

n total debt net of current portions in thousands between 2004 and 2005 is $1,232 million. This can be calculated as follows:

In 2004, the total debt was $1,438 million, and the net of current portions was $1,232 million.

In 2005, the total debt was $1,540 million, and the net of current portions was $1,232 million + $108 million = $1,340 million.

Therefore, the change in total debt net of current portions in thousands between 2004 and 2005 was $1,340 million - $1,232 million = $108 million
