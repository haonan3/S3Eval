 Passage is as follows 
 The Young Lions is a professional football team based in Singapore. The team is under the direct control of the Football Association of Singapore ( FAS ), but is managed as a football club and has competed in Singapore's top club competition - the Singapore Premier League - since 2003. The Young Lions are one of the few football clubs in the world which place an age restriction on team members while playing in a top-flight professional league. Most of the Singaporean members in the Young Lions squad also represent the country in under-23 international tournaments. The Young Lions play their league matches at the Jurong West Stadium. Their best S.League finish was third, which they achieved in 2004 and 2006. [ citation needed ]Jalan Besar Stadium is a 6,000-capacity football stadium located in Kallang, Singapore.

Passage is as follows 
 Sydney ( /ˈsɪdni/ ( listen ) SID-nee ) is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania. Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds Port Jackson and extends about 70 km ( 43.5 mi ) on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west, Hawkesbury to the north, the Royal National Park to the south and Macarthur to the south-west. Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs, 40 local government areas and 15 contiguous regions. Residents of the city are known as Sydneysiders. As of June 2017, Sydney's estimated metropolitan population was 5,230,330 and is home to approximately 65% of the state's population. Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years, and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region, making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites. During his first Pacific voyage in 1770, Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia, making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area.

 jpmorgan chase & co. / 2005 annual report 123 litigation reserve the firm maintains litigation reserves for certain of its litigations, including its material legal proceedings. while the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, management believes, in light of all information known to it at december 31, 2005, that the firm 2019s litigation reserves were adequate at such date. management reviews litigation reserves periodically, and the reserves may be increased or decreased in the future to reflect further litigation devel- opments. the firm believes it has meritorious defenses to claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding litigation and, with respect to such liti- gation, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according to management 2019s judgment as to what is in the best interest of stockholders. note 26 2013 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities derivative instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to credit or market risks. the value of a derivative is derived from its reference to an underlying variable or combination of variables such as equity, foreign exchange, credit, commodity or interest rate prices or indices. jpmorgan chase makes markets in derivatives for customers and also is an end-user of derivatives in order to manage the firm 2019s exposure to credit and market risks. sfas 133, as amended by sfas 138 and sfas 149, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including those used for trading and hedging activities, and derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. all free-standing derivatives, whether designated for hedging rela- tionships or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. the accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether the contract is for trading purposes or has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. the majority of the firm 2019s derivatives are entered into for trading purposes. the firm also uses derivatives as an end

tte Perry Award for Excellence in Broadway Theatre, more commonly known as the Tony Award, recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre. The awards are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League at an annual ceremony in Midtown Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances, and an award is given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are also given, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award. The awards are named after Antoinette Tony Perry, co-founder of the American Theatre Wing. The trophy consists of a medallion, with a face portraying an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks, mounted on a black base with a pewter swivel. The rules for the Tony Awards are set forth in the official document Rules and Regulations of The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards, which applies for that season only. The Tony Awards are considered the highest U.S. theatre honor, the New York theatre industry's equivalent to the Academy Awards ( Oscars ) for film, the Emmy Awards for television, and the Grammy Awards for music. It also forms the fourth spoke in the EGOT, that is, someone who has won all four major annual American entertainment awards. The Tony Awards are also considered the equivalent of the Laurence Olivier Awards in the United Kingdom and the Molière Awards in France.

## **RNA interference (RNAi)**

RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules can silence gene expression by cleaving the complementary mRNA strand or by destabilizing the mRNA molecule. The process is mediated by a class of small non-coding RNA molecules called small interfering RNA (siRNA). The process is also known as RNA silencing or post-transcriptional gene silencing. The process is used by many organisms to defend against viral infection.

 Argentina ( Spanish : [ aɾxenˈtina ] ), officially the Argentine Republic [ A ] ( Spanish : República Argentina ), is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ), [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the fourth largest in the Americas, the second largest in South America after Brazil, and the largest Spanish-speaking nation. The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias, singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad autónoma ), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ), and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period. The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian

itschel ( born 28 September 1945 in Sainte-Maxime ) is a former French alpine skier. Marielle is the younger sister of Christine Goitschel, another champion skier of the time, and the aunt of speed skier Philippe Goitschel. After great success in the 1962 World Championships and 1964 Winter Olympics, winning 5 medals including 3 golds, Goitschel was considered the world's best female skier. She continued her domination at the 1966 World Championships in Portillo, Chile, winning medals in all 4 events, with 3 golds and one silver. When the alpine skiing World Cup debuted a few months after those championships in January 1967, Goitschel was expected to again dominate the circuit that season. However, she narrowly lost the overall title to Nancy Greene of Canada, but did take the discipline cup in downhill and tied for the win in slalom with her compatriot Annie Famose. She won her final gold medal in slalom at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, and then retired from ski racing after that season. Goitschel's total of 11 World Championships medals in alpine skiing is second all-time among women to the 15 won by Christl Cranz of Germany ( see the note below ). Marielle and sister Christine were the first ever female siblings on the same individual's event Olympic podium, winning the gold ( Christine ) and silver ( Marielle ) medals in the 1964 Olympic Women's slalom. They would repeat the feat two days later, switching their gold-silver order, in the 1964 Olympic Women's giant slalom.Alpine skiing at the 1968 Winter Olympics consisted of six events, held 9-17 February at Chamrousse, southeast of Grenoble, France. Jean-Claude Killy of France won all three men's events, repeating Toni Sailer's triple-gold of 1956. Since Killy's feat, no male alpine ski racer has won three gold medals in a single Olympics. ( Janica Kostelic later won three gold medals in the 2002 Winter Olympics ). This was the first Olympics with a two-run men's giant slalom, with one run per day. The women's giant slalom was one run until 1980. For the only time, the results from Olympic races were included in the World Cup standings, then in its second season. Following the 1970 season,

( abbrev. Stz ), sold under many brand names, is an androgen and anabolic steroid ( AAS ) medication which was derived from dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ), it is used to treat hereditary angioedema. It was developed by American pharmaceutical company Winthrop Laboratories ( Sterling Drug ) in 1962, and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use, though it is no longer marketed in the USA. It is also used in veterinary medicine. Stanozolol has mostly been discontinued, and remains available in only a few countries. It is given by mouth in humans or by injection into muscle in animals. Unlike most injectable AAS, stanozolol is not esterified and is sold as an aqueous suspension, or in oral tablet form. The drug has a high oral bioavailability, due to a C17α alkylation which allows the hormone to survive first-pass liver metabolism when ingested. It is because of this that stanozolol is also sold in tablet form. Stanozolol is one of the AAS commonly used as performance-enhancing drugs and is banned from use in sports competition under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) and many other sporting bodies. Additionally, stanozolol has been used in US horse racing.

Question: What banned substance was taken by the athlete born on 11 July 1962?The answer to this question is: 
Furosemide ( abbrev. Fus ), sold under the brand name Lasix among others, is a medication used to treat fluid build-up due to heart failure, liver scarring, or kidney disease. It may also be used for the treatment of high blood pressure. It can be taken by injection into a vein or by mouth. When taken by mouth, it typically begins working within an hour, while intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes. Common side effects include feeling lightheaded with standing, ringing in the ears, and sensitivity to light. Potentially serious side effects include electrolyte abnormalities, low blood pressure, and hearing loss. Blood tests are recommended regularly for those on treatment. Furosemide is a type of loop diuretic that works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys. Furosemide was patented in 1959 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest
